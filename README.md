This was a project built as the exercise portion of pragmatic studio's rails 1 course.

New things I learned:
  Keep "business" logic in the model. Keep this kind of code out of the controller and views.
  Create helper methods to also keep ruby code out of your views.
  TESTING: Writing and using test for test driven development.
  Using nested resources in routes.
  How to work with error messages, notice, and flash.
  Using initializers.
It is deployed on Heroku
